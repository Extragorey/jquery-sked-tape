### Changed
- Long events are clamped to the end of the timeline, but not to the start of the timeline. This is now fixed.

## [2.0.0] 2019-06-02
### Changed
- Doesn't work with dates in UTC timezone anymore.
  Now you should pass all your dates to the plugin in local timezone, and
  they'll be shown in it (or any you specify) as well.
### Added
- Every location now may has individual timezone offset.
